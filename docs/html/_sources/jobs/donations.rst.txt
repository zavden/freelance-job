Preamble - Updated July 20, 2020
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Unfortunately, the computer I used to  make the animations has passed into  a better life.

For now the only computer I have is  this one, and it is very low resources, so the tutorials will take longer to  complete, until I can buy a new computer.

If you like this material and you have  the capacity to support me, a donation  would be of great help.

If you don't want to give away me your  money, you can also hire me as a Freelance, to create particular animations made in  Manim, or private tutorials, see :ref:`here <main_page>`.

If you have the capacity to help me, but  you don't know if it is worth it, here is  a small preview of all the projects that  are to come:

* 10 - Formulas transformations workflow.
* 11 - `Long animation worflow <https://zavden.github.io/long-animation-workflow/docs/html/index.html>`_
* 12 - New features of Manim and ManimCommunity.
* 13 - PyCharm + Manim & JupyterNotebook + Manim.
* 14 - How to convert class animations into Updaters.
* 15 - Advanced construction of VMobjects and how to animate them.

From this point on, I will start creating  a new series of videos, in which I will teach you to create THREE tools similar to Manim, built from scratch, but with the following  programming languages:

    * C/C ++
    * Java
    * NodeJS (JavaScript)

I will call this last project :math:`\mbox{AniMathed}`,  and to create this course I will based on  Manim and 2 other similar tools:

    * `SimuLeios <https://github.com/leios/simuleios>`_ - By `LeiosOS <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd0dc7kQA1FUpJ76o1EjLqQ>`_ (C++/Fortran)
    * `Reanimate <https://github.com/reanimate/reanimate>`_ - By `Reanimated Science <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL7MwXLtQbhJeb6Ts3_HooA>`_ (Haskell)

All these projects I will carry out  regardless of whether there are donations  or not, but obviously, it will take longer  (I calculate from 1 to 2 years) if I do not have the right tools.

If donations are enough, I will be able to get myself a better computer and spend more time on these projects and finish it as soon as possible.

In addition to being able to get the necessary equipment to be able to re-narrate the videos.

So if someone wants to sponsor this project more actively, they will have some control over the projects to come.

I hope you like future projects.

Until next time.

Alexander.
