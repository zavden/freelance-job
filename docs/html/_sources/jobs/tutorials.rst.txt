Private tutorials
-------------------

Given the technical limitations of my PC, I can only perform personalized tutorials in the following ways:

1. You will have to make a list with all your doubts and send it to me, I will evaluate the complexity of your questions and I will estimate a price.
2. If you want to learn how to make a specific animation, send it to me and I will estimate the price.

The payment method is the same as the animations on request, a part is paid in advance depending on the price.

At the moment I do not have the ability to video/audio chat due to the capabilities of my PC and my internet connection.

The way I teach is in two ways:
    * Through a PDF + Private Videos / Discord chat (the cheapest).
    * Through a Web page like this (but it is more expensive).

.. note:: To give you an idea of how much a private tutorial costs, I charged $ 60 for `this job <https://zavden.github.io/long-animation-workflow/docs/html/index.html>`_ where I teach the workflow of long animations.

.. tip:: The tutorials **are yours and yours alone**, but if you give me permission to release the documents to share with the Manim community, then the price decreases.
