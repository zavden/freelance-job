Hire me as a Freelance!
=========================================

Due to the circumstances we are experiencing I have been forced to look for work in new places.

I am rendering my services in these two types of jobs:

.. 1. Animations on request.
   2. Private tutorials.

.. toctree::
   /jobs/request.rst
   /jobs/tutorials.rst
   /jobs/donations.rst
   /jobs/examples.rst
   :maxdepth: 1


.. tip:: If you can proof me that you work for some **public** educational institution, I will give you a considerable discount, but the delivery date of the projects should be more flexible.

Payments are made via PayPal or bank transfer.
